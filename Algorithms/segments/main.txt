If we Reach The Destination Break the loop
Else we have a break condition 2 inside the loop

while(e < n){
            while(i <= n and v[i].second <= e){ -> 1st Main Condtion to Eliminate Common Parts
               i++;
            }
            if(v[i].first > e){ -> If 1st Condtion Failed Break.
                break;
            }
            while(i <= n and e >= v[i].first){ -> 2nd Main Condtion to Update the Effect For 1st
                mx = max(mx, v[i].second);
                i++;
            }
            count++;
            e = max(e, mx);
            
        }
